Creating a pcl package to view trees:
* mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
* cd ~/catkin_ws/
* catkin_init_workspace

* cd ~/catkin/src/
* catkin_create_pkg my_pcl_tutorial pcl_conversions pcl_ros roscpp sensor_msgs
* modify package.xml as per: http://wiki.ros.org/pcl/Tutorials
* Create source file
* Add source file to package CMakeLists.txt
* catkin build (NOT catkin_make since catkin_init_workspace was used?? But not sure)

* Set the required gazebo plugin/resources/models path as environment variable
* Currently velodyne is not being simulated in ROS melodic. Seeting LD_LIBRARY_PATH, GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH, GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH, etc. to point to .so file still leads to the error:
gzserver: symbol lookup error: /home/rxth/rakshith/data/work/asu/dreams/treeMapping/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libgazebo_ros_velodyne_laser.so: undefined symbol: _ZN2tf7resolveERKNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES7_
* But it runs fine on Gazebo 7 (ie ros kinetic)
